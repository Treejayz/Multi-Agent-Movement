We used ray cast for obstacle avoidance

The Emergent formation is very loose, whereas the scalable is very rigid, and the 
two-level is a nice blend between the two.

The heuristics to get the agents to go through the tunnels involved checking the agents progress along the path and forcing them to take turns.

Some additional rules check if any agents have become too separated and if the rest of the flock needs to slow down or wait.
